# Facial Attribute Search Engine

The main objective of this project is to develop a Face Search Engine based on the attributes of a desired database like CelebA, LFWA that allows users to query images from the dataset and web based on facial attributes within the database as well as for attributes with no samples in the database by incorporating web mining techniques. The search engine will also allow users to perform instantaneous relabeling of mislabeled queried images for datasets with binary attributes manually.
